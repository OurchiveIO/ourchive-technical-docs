Ourchive MVP has a light and dark theme. Both are built with [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/). You can find these themes, as well as instructions for project installation, in the GitHub project's [README](https://github.com/c-e-p/ourchive-themes).

We do not have a dedicated frontend developer, and our backend developer has a black thumb. If you are a frontend/UI person who's interested in helping out, please check out our [community]({{< relref "developer_community" >}})!
