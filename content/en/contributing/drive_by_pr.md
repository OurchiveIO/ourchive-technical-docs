Thank you for wanting to contribute! While we are always happy to have more people in our developer community, we also welcome one-time contributions. The short version is you can create a PR at any time, for any reason. Specific use cases are described below.

{{< toc >}}

## Bug Fixes

We welcome any & all bug fixes. Our bug tracker can be found on (GitHub)[https://changeme]. Anything in the 'To Do' column should have reproduction steps and clear acceptance criteria. When you've fixed the bug, create a PR for review.

## New Features

We are just a few people doing this on nights & weekends, so our development lifecycle is a bit loosey-goosey. Our process looks like: 

1. Brainstorm privately or accept proposals from our community
2. Add the proposed feature to our (Idea Board)[https://changeme]
3. Decide to include it in the project; add an issue to to our ('New' lane)[https://changeme]
4. Add acceptance criteria to the feature; move to the ('To Do' lane)[https://changeme]
5. Build the feature

Anything in Step 4 would be a 'new feature' and you are welcome to build it! When you PR, we will review against the acceptance criteria, and may request changes based on UX or other concerns. You can review our quality standards (here)[https://changeme].

If you want more consistent/granular feedback, we would suggest joining our developer community. Otherwise, if any questions arise during feature development, just @ us on the GitHub issue and we'll do our best to elaborate.

Our goal is to stick to our core development philosophies (e.g. minimal dependencies) while ensuring anyone who wants to can in fact contribute. If you have any suggestions for facilitating that, please (contact us)[https://changeme].

## Roadmap Features

Roadmap features are features which we plan to build, but haven't prioritized or specced yet. We welcome help with this. Please review our (feature standards)[https://changemetoqualitystandards#featurestandards] for preferred format. Ideally, your PR will include the feature with our template, to allow us to test using our standard process. Depending on complexity of the feature and how you build it, we may or may not merge upstream changes. As with new features, if you have questions or really want to see the feature make it into Ourchive, please don't hesitate to reach out.
